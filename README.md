# Welcome to Initia, a Network for Interwoven Rollups

At its core, Initia reconstructs the entire technological stack, introducing a foundational Layer 1 blockchain integrated with a bespoke Layer 2 infrastructure. This integration fosters a tightly knit ecosystem of modular networks. Owning the complete technological stack enables Initia to implement chain-level mechanisms that harmonize the economic interests of users, developers, Layer 2 app-chains, and the Layer 1 chain itself.

The Initia Layer 1 serves as an orchestration layer, facilitating coordination of security, liquidity, routing, and interoperability across the network of interwoven rollups via the VM-Agnostic Optimistic Rollup frameworkâ€”the OPinit Stack. This framework, supported by fraud proofs and rollback capabilities, allows for the secure scaling of rollups based on CosmosSDK in environments like EVM, MoveVM, or WasmVM, all while leveraging Celestia's Data Availability (DA) layer.

## Native Apps

Initia's product stack unifies the architecture, offering users a singular chain experience when interacting with thousands of interwoven rollups and reducing entry barriers:
