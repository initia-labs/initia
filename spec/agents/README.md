# Agent Notes

This directory stores short, high-signal runbooks for future coding agents.

## Files

- `initiad-e2e.md`: lessons and guardrails for `initiad` multi-node e2e work.

## Writing rules

- Keep entries practical and test-focused.
- Include exact commands/flags when they are known to be required.
- Prefer short checklists over long explanations.
