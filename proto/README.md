# Maintaining Initia Proto Files

All of the Initia proto files are defined here. This folder should
be synced regularly with buf.build/initia-labs/initia regularly by
a maintainer by running `buf push` in this folder.

User facing documentation should not be placed here but instead goes in
`buf.md` and in each protobuf package following the guidelines in
<https://buf.build/docs/bsr/documentation/overview/>.

## Generate

To get the Initia proto given a commit, run:

```bash
buf export buf.build/initia-labs/initia:${commit} --output .
```
